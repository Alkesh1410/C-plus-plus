# Polymorphism:
Polymorphism is a mechanism which states that we can use one name with different-different forms/ways.
Like for example, you can use same function name multiple times(which performs different tasks)
[Note: Though there are certain rules and restrictions on ways using it].
Compile time:
when a certain task (to be done) is resolved during compilation, that is called compile-time polymorphism
Also called EARLY BINDING
Run time:
when a certain task (to be done) is resolved during the execution, that is called runtime polymorphism
Also called LATE BINDING

# Data Abstraction:
Hiding of data (non useful information) is called data abstraction.
for example:
If you are developing calculator, Your objective is to get the proper calculated data using whatever business logic you have developed.
In this case what variables are performing the operations should not be your concern.
Thus hiding those variable is nothing but data abstraction.
We can perform data abstraction using the access specifier (Public, Protected and Private).

# Data Encapsulating:
The process of putting (wrapping) data (i.e. variables) and its information (i.e. Methods/Functions) into a single unit is called Encapsulation.
Again We can perform data encapsulation using the access specifier (Public, Protected and Private).

# Inheritance:
Ability of a class to derive the similar characteristics in another class (called child class/derived class) maybe with some of the existing characteristics of its own is called Inheritance.
